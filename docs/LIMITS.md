# Processing boundaries

OCR can misread text. Latent semantic analysis learns from the selected corpus, not from general knowledge. Indexing uses explicit file, text, and chunk limits. Keyword search remains available when the semantic corpus is too large.

Inputs are bounded to protect local memory and execution time. The shared file reader normally accepts up to 25 MiB per source. Text extraction and semantic search have separate character and chunk limits. Errors identify unsupported or truncated data. Split large inputs rather than disabling checks.

No API key is required. Installation is separate from runtime. Extra executables and local model files must be installed before their features can run. The application never downloads an AI model automatically.

The encrypted database protects stored records, not source files, screenshots, exports, swap, or an already compromised user session. Back up the vault and keep its passphrase separately.
